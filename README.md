# gilbot-alexa

This is an Alexa Skill based on the Gilbot project for obtaining Watching recommendations.  It uses the <a href="https://github.com/matt-kruse/alexa-app">alexa-app</a> node module to connect to Alexa.

It is based on the <a href="http://www.smorgasbork.com/2015/09/06/ruuvu-building-an-alexa-skill-with-alexa-app/">Ruuvu tutorial blogpost</a> by Jason Priebe. Significant logic and ideas were borrowed from / copied out of <a href="https://github.com/nytlabs/gilbot">the Slack version of Gilbot</a>.
