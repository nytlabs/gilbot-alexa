			"description": "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the passing of &ldquo;American Idol.&rdquo; Or if not mourn, exactly, at least acknowledge the end of the last show America truly agreed on. After 15 seasons, &ldquo;Idol&rdquo; takes its final bow Thursday night after a surprisingly solid last outing — some strong contestants, some cogent and thoughtful commentary from the current judging panel of Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez and Harry Connick Jr. &ldquo;Idol&rdquo; could have ended years ago and our world would have been none the poorer, but let’s pour one out for the House That Clarkson Built."
